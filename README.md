# Project 2DGameSDK

## Purpose

This Project represents a fully functional game engine for 2D Games that is 
meant to work in the most common desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS).

## Documentation

See Full Doxygen generated Documentation at: 
https://markoczy.github.io/2DGameSDK/

## Examples

The Project contains several usage examples of the game engine, these are 
located in the folder `Project_Prototype`. Compiling the Source Code in that
folder creates an executable named `Prototype.exe`. All the examples can be
run from this exe, to choose the Example to run, use the following command
arguments:

- Minimal Demo: `Prototype.exe minimal`
- Player Demo: `Prototype.exe player`
- Chopper Demo: `Prototype.exe chopper`
- GTA2 Player Demo: `Prototype.exe gta2`
- Physics Demo: `Prototype.exe physics`

The following commands start the prototypes, these are more advanced than the
demos above:

- Prototype 1: `Prototype.exe proto1`
- Prototype 2: `Prototype.exe proto2`

Have fun! (sorry that the examples are windows oriented...)
